			You should be aware that there are certain things that OceanBit LLC will
			not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the
			app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
			provided by your mobile network provider, but OceanBit LLC cannot take
			responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t
			have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

		<p class="bodyPTag">
			If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember
			that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will
			still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for
			the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
			app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
			responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you
			use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country)
			without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
			device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that
			you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

			Along the same lines, OceanBit LLC cannot always take responsibility for

		<p class="bodyPTag">
			With respect to OceanBit LLC’s responsibility for your use of the app,

			At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently
			available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for
			any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
			may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
			using the app. OceanBit LLC does not promise that it will always update
			the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp;
			iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise
			to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
			also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
			time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
